# CS50 Problem Set 3 🚀

Welcome to my CS50 Problem Set 3 repository! This set dives into more advanced data manipulation using arrays and introduces essential search algorithms. Let's explore the fascinating world of arrays and searching! 🧐

## Array 📊

- **Filename:** `array.c`
- **Description:** This program demonstrates various array manipulations in C. It allows the user to input a series of numbers, then performs a variety of operations to showcase the power of arrays. These operations include finding the maximum, minimum, average, and the gap between the maximum and minimum values. Additionally, it explores more advanced concepts like finding the second maximum, reversing the array, filtering even numbers, and creatively merging array halves.

## Search 🔍

- **Filename:** `search.c`
- **Description:** This program performs a case-insensitive search of a keyword within a given text. The user is prompted to enter a text and a keyword, and the program reports the position of the keyword within the text if found. This illustrates a practical application of string searching algorithms in C.

## Getting Started 🏁

To interact with these programs, clone the repository and compile each file using `clang` or `make`. Execute the compiled program in the terminal, follow the prompts, and witness the array manipulations and search algorithms in action!
